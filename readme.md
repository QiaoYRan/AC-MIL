# AC-MIL
Official implementation for AC-MIL

## Notice
Due to the **high sensitivity of risk control business data**, the official complete dataset and full-version code are currently undergoing the internal corporate review and approval process.

## Current Available Version
At this stage, we have released a **toy data runnable version** of the code in this repository. This version is fully executable with toy data and can perfectly demonstrate the complete running pipeline of the model.

## Upcoming Update
Once internal approval is obtained, we will immediately update this repository with the final complete version, including:
1. Formal **desensitized dataset** (privacy-protected, anonymized)
2. Optimized full pipeline code with business data
3. Comprehensive user guide and technical appendix
